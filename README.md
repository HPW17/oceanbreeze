## **Introduction**
An interactive and fully responsive website for a fictional summer vacation resort, focusing on creating a seamless and engaging user experience. This project served as a comprehensive application of my skills in front-end web development, from conceptual design to final implementation. The objective was to build a user-friendly and visually appealing site that could showcase the resort's services and attract potential visitors.
